# Traffic-Surveillance-System

Traffic surveillance systems have been around for quite a while across various cities worldwide. The ubiquitous presence of closed circuit cameras, vehicle plate detection systems and LED lane control lights has made traffic and incident management smooth and efficient. 

In a traffic management system, the surveillance component is the process in which data is collected in the field. This data is used to supply information about conditions in the field to other system components. Surveillance provides the information needed to perform the following functions:
      
      1. Measure traffic and environmental conditions. 
      2. Make control decisions. 
      3. Monitor system performance.

To build a custom object detection system with respect to traffic surveillance like vehicle classification, helmet detection, triple riding detection & number plate detection. So, the complete project aims at developing a model to classify the type of vehicles, helmet detection, number plate detection and triple riding detection.

# Datasets:
Dataset collected by whole team members in real time from different states of India. The locations were selected in such a way that we can get a heterogenous traffic volume and varying traffic flow so that we can observe various categories of vehicles, large number of vehicles so that chances of getting such data set where it can be observed that traffic rules are violated like absence of number plate, helmet and triple riding cases. Also, we collected the dataset in different lighting condition, so that it can work in any lighting condition on real time.

We label the dataset with 6 classes.

      1. Car
      2. Bus
      3. Bike
      4. Auto
      5. Mgv
      6. Truck
